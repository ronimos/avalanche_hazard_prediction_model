The crown connected from tree to tree. , Submitting this observation on behalf of the party who triggered and was caught and carried in this avalanche. I was able to investigate the crown of this avalanche on my descent and got decent pictures. Farther down on my group's descent one of my partners also triggered a small persistent slab avalanche on a small steep slope that sees sun exposure and willow facet-farm effects. Three avalanches were observed in all but the biggest one was unintentionally triggered and resulted in the skier taking a short ride on top of the debris. They were not buried or injured and were able to ski out on their own. That said I believe this is the first avalanche of this nature to occur in this area this season. There was around 4 feet of debris piled on the uphill side of several trees. It's possible this triggered another sympathetic slide out of view behind a tree island as the terrain wrapped aspect to the south as more debris was observed in the flats below. , The avalanche failed on a crust/facet combo layer beneath the 1/4 interface. , O, approved, -, Interface, 60, ft, -, ft, 24, in, -

This large soft slab avalanche filled a relatively narrow path (SS-AS(u)-R3-D2). The area was too dangerous for a crown profile. Still it is assumed that the avalanche broke on a layer of near-surface facets and surface hoar responsible for a widespread avalanche cycle in the region. The weak snow layer formed during a prolonged dry period in December that was buried by approximately 30&rdquo; of snow falling during a series of storms that began on January 4th. The avalanche broke approximately 50&rsquo; wide and 1-3&rsquo; deep and entrained more snow along the flanks of a shallow gully. The avalanche fell approximately 600 vertical feet. The slide path is one of several sparsely wooded avalanche paths on the northwest face of Little Poudre Mountain that run the full 1200&rsquo; length of the face. (Figure 1) This avalanche was one of the dozens reported in the region during a particularly active avalanche cycle. (Figure 2)</p> <p><strong>Backcountry Avalanche Forecast</strong></p> <p>The Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center forecast on January 14 2024 rated the avalanche danger in the Greys River zone at High in elevation bands above 7500&rsquo; and Considerable below. Persistent slab avalanches were the primary avalanche problem on all aspects above 7500&rsquo;. The expected size of the persistent slabs was projected to be large to very large (D2-3) and very likely to be human-triggered. Deep persistent slab avalanches were also listed as possible ranging from large to very large or D2 to D3.5. The Bottom Line section of the day&rsquo;s forecast stated:</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist today. Triggering an avalanche large enough to bury injure or kill a person is likely in avalanche terrain at all elevations. In addition destructive natural avalanches are likely in the middle and upper elevations. Traveling in near or under avalanche terrain is not recommended today.</p>, -, O, approved, -, -, 50, ft, 600, ft, 24, in, -
